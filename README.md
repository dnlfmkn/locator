 `git clone $your_forked_repo_url`
* Reset the origin of your repo to point to the original repo (this repo) by running the following command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/dnlfmkn/locator`. This will keep your forked repo in sync with the original repo.
* Afterwards, create a new branch with your git username like so: `git checkout -b $git_username`
