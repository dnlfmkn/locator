# Backend
The backend is written in Python. If you're going to be dealing with this side, it would be best to manage your dependencies using a virtual environment. This will allow you to avoid clashes between dependencies that require differing versions of the Python runtime. 
* You can get the `virtualenv` package by running this command: `pip install virtualenv`
* In the root directory for this project, create your virtual environment by running: `virtualenv -p py venv`
* To activate your virtual environment on Mac run: `source /venv/bin/activate`. On Windows, first `cd venv/Scripts` then `source activate`. 
* To leave your virtual environment, on Mac run : `source /venv/bin/deactivate`. On Windows, first `cd venv/Scripts` then `source deactivate`.
